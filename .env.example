# Development Environment Variables
# This is set automatically by Amplify
VITE_APP_ENV="development | staging | production"

# GitHub token note
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT put GitHub tokens in VITE_* variables.
# VITE_* values are embedded into the client bundle and become public.
#
# Instead, store your token as an Amplify secret for the backend function:
#   ampx sandbox secret set GITHUB_TOKEN
# or set it in Amplify Console (Secrets).
#
# Optional (non-secret): username for the backend GitHub proxy function
# GITHUB_USERNAME=khenderson20

# AWS Amplify Configuration (auto-generated)

# VITE_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
# VITE_AWS_USER_POOL_ID=your_user_pool_id
# VITE_AWS_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
